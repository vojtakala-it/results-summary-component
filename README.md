## My process

I began thinking about how to set up the layout and then wrote the HTML.
When I was done, I started styling the template.
What I did wrong is that I started styling from 1000+ resolution, next time I should start with mobile version first.
I spend a lot of time thinking about how to write my CSS in a better and more clear way.
Also fixing and tuning the responsive design was also a pain that took my a long time.
But I'm getting better, baby steps.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- ES5
- Webpack

    * when/how to use em/rem and why ?
    * when/how to use vmin/vmax or vw/vh and why ?
    * what about setting values in % ?
    * how to combine CSS Grid with Flexbox effectively and why ?
* Have to improve my skills regarding CSS animations and transitions
* Have to get faster at writing HTML & CSS
* Have to use JS more and get more proficient at it
* How to structure your CSS the best way ?
  * What about syntax, should I keep using nesting ?
